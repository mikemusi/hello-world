Intro to GitHub

By my 26th birthday I'd like to apply 2-3 learned skills of data science (Machine Learning, Data Engineering, Experimental, Insight) to a part-time project (20+ hours per week invested for at least 2-3 weeks) for substaintial benefit. Bonus points if the project benefits social good, but acceptable as a work project or Kaggle contest.
